Deployment Plan

To deploy this project in the cloud using AWS, I would split the system into three key parts: 
the API
the database, and 
the scheduled data ingestion.

Below is how I would approach deploying each:


1. Database: Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL)
I would use Amazon RDS to host the PostgreSQL database.
RDS is a fully managed service that handles backups, patching, and scaling.
The database would be placed in a private subnet within a VPC for security.
Connection credentials would be stored in AWS Secrets Manager.

2. API: AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS Fargate
Option A: Elastic Beanstalk (simpler setup)
Deploy the Flask API using Elastic Beanstalk.
Beanstalk manages the provisioning of EC2 instances, load balancing, scaling, and deployment.

Option B: AWS Fargate + ECS (container-based)
Package the API in a Docker container.
Push the image to Amazon Elastic Container Registry.
Deploy and run it using AWS Fargate through ECS for a serverless container-based approach.
Application Load Balancer with HTTPS enabled via AWS Certificate Manager would be used in either case


3. Scheduled Ingestion â€“ AWS Lambda or Fargate Scheduled Task
Option A: AWS Lambda + EventBridge 
If the ingestion script is lightweight and completes within Lambda limits (memory, runtime), I would wrap the script in a Lambda function.
Schedule it using Amazon EventBridge  to run periodically.

Option B: ECS Fargate Scheduled Task
If the script is more complex or needs more resources/time, I would run it in a container as a Scheduled Task in ECS (Fargate) triggered by EventBridge.

4. Secrets & Configuration Management
Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store to store DB credentials and sensitive config.
Access these secrets securely from both the API and ingestion jobs using IAM roles.

5. CI/CD Pipeline
Use GitHub Actions or AWS CodePipeline to automate testing and deployment.
On push to the main branch, the pipeline would:
Run tests
Build the Docker image
Deploy to ECS or Beanstalk
Trigger infrastructure updates
